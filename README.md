# Internship Tasks Repository

Welcome to my **ShadowFox** repository! This repository contains the tasks that I have worked on during my internship, organized into two categories: **Beginner** and **Intermediate**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `beginner/`: Contains tasks that are suited for beginner-level knowledge and skills.
- `intermediate/`: Contains tasks that require a deeper understanding or more advanced techniques.

## Folders

### Beginner Tasks
The **beginner** folder contains tasks that focus on basic concepts and techniques. These tasks are intended to help you get started with the essential skills you need for further development.

#### Example of beginner tasks:
- Task 1: Variables
- Task 2: Numbers
- Task 3: List

### Intermediate Tasks
The **Intermediate** folder contains tasks that go beyond the basics. These tasks require a deeper understanding of the field and may involve problem-solving, algorithms, or practical implementation of complex concepts.

#### Example of intermediate tasks:
- Task 1:  Web Scraper: Extract data from websites using libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.
- Task 2: Hangman: Implement the wordguessing game with visual progress and hints.
